# Final Year Project - John Walsh

## Project Details
This project involved building a quad-copter drone and developing my own basic stabilization firmware
which was crucial in making flight even possible with this type of craft.

The project overall has been more of research project then a full on development project, documentation can 
be found in the supplied PDF file.
