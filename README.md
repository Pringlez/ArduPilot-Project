# Final Year Project - John Walsh

This project involves building a quad-copter drone and developing my own basic stabilization firmware
which is crucial to make flight even possible with this type of craft.

The Project overall has been more of research project then a full on development project, documentation can 
be found in the supplied PDF file.

The documentation as of 20/04/2015 is not complete yet, I'll continue to update until the end of exams in May.
